========================

``sphinxcontrib.spelling`` is a spelling checker for Sphinx_.  It uses
PyEnchant_ to produce a report showing misspelled words.

Features
========

1. Supports multiple source languages using the standard enchant
   dictionaries.
2. Supports project-specific dictionaries for localized jargon and
   other terminology that may not appear in the global dictionaries.
3. Suggests alternatives to words not found in the dictionary, when
   possible.
