.. spelling::

   unmaintained

6.0.0
=====

With this release, sphinxcontrib-spelling moves from beta to
stable. It also updates the use of Python 3, including packaging
metadata, code style, and test configuration.

New Features
------------

- Add packaging metadata declaring the project stable.
- Add packaging metadata declaring support for Python 3 only.
- Add packaging metadata indicating that this is a sphinx extension.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Replace use of deprecated `imp` module with `importlib`.
- Update use of `pyenchant.get_tokenizer()` to pass filters argument
  as a keyword and avoid a runtime warning message.
- Remove unused test dependency on `fixtures`.
- Use `pyupgrade` to modernize the source code.

5.4.0
=====

New Features
------------

- Added a new filter
  (``sphinxcontrib.spelling.filters.ContributorFilter``) that treats
  contributor names extracted from the git history as spelled
  correctly, making it easier to refer to the names in
  acknowledgments . Includes a new configuration option,
  ``spelling_ignore_contributor_names`` to enable it.

5.3.0
=====

New Features
------------

- Add a configuration option ``spelling_exclude_patterns`` to manage
  skipping spell checking for some input files. The option uses a
  list of glob-style patterns that are matched against the source
  file names relative to the source directory. See :doc:`/customize`
  for more details. Contributed by sdelliot.

5.2.2
=====

Bug Fixes
---------

- Updated to only create ``.spelling`` output files for inputs that
  generate spelling warnings. Fixes #63.

5.2.0
=====

New Features
------------

- The builder is now registered using an entry point, so that if the
  ``spelling`` directive is not used in a project
  ``sphinxcontrib.spelling`` does not need to be included explicitly
  in the ``extensions`` list in ``conf.py`` in order to use it with
  the project on the command line.

- PyEnchant is an optional dependency. If it is not installed, the
  spell checker will not work, but the extension can still be
  initialized. This allows projects that use spell checking to
  publish their documentation to ``readthedocs.org``, where it is
  not possible to install PyEnchant.

- Restore support for parallel builds. Words that do not appear in
  any configured dictionary are written to a file named based on the
  input file, with the ``.rst`` extension replaced with
  ``.spelling``.
