   Homebrew
   libenchant
   macOS
   unmaintained

7.4.1
=====

- `#160 <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/issues/160>`__
  Fixed issue with the builder crashing when reporting a misspelled word
  in a python docstring.

7.4.0
=====

- Fix a problem that occurred when the extra word list is empty and an
  IndexError is thrown. Prevent the error by checking the contents of
  the file before using the list.
- `#153 <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/issues/153>`__
  Ensure the correct relative filename is reported as the location of
  a misspelled word when the word is in an included file. Log the
  location ourselves instead of letting the logging system compute it
  for consistency until `the fix
  <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/10460>`__ is merged into
  Sphinx.
- Change default env list for local tox runs to only include the
  current python version, as defined by the installation of tox.
- Tell tox to pass `PYENCHANT_LIBRARY_PATH` through to commands. On
  macOS it can be a little tricky to set up libenchant if your default
  python does not match the one used by Homebrew for the
  library. Setting the variable to point to the library fixes that,
  but we don't want to set it in this file for everyone so use
  `passenv` to tell tox to pass the setting through when running the
  commands for each env.
- `#159 <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/issues/159>`__
  Report using the line number of the misspelled word instead of using
  the first line of the node, in both the log and `.spelling` output
  file.

7.3.3
=====

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#149 <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/pull/149>`__ Fixes
  to support testing when building RPMs. Switch to PEP 420 native
  namespace and skip contributors test when not in a git repo.
- `#150 <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/pull/150>`__ Minor
  code cleanup primarily around string interpolation.

7.3.2
=====

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#143 <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/pull/143>`__ Treat
  ``__main__`` as a special module name that cannot be imported. If
  the test suite is invoked by running ``python -m pytest`` instead of
  ``pytest`` then there will be no ``__main__`` and find_spec() will
  fail, so this change makes the tests work in both modes.
- `#144 <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/pull/144>`__ Fix
  python filename handling in ``ImportableModuleFilter``.  If the word
  looks like a python module filename, strip the extension to avoid
  the side-effect of actually importing the module. This prevents, for
  example, ``'setup.py'`` triggering an import of the ``setup`` module
  during a doc build, which makes it look like Sphinx is complaining
  about a commandline argument.

7.3.1
=====

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#137 <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/pull/137>`__
  replace the use of deprecated ``imp`` in ``ImportableModuleFilter``
  with ``importlib``

7.3.0
=====

New Features
------------

- `#131 <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/pull/131>`__
  included a documentation update to fix a broken link.

- `#130 <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/pull/130>`__ tested support
  for Python 3.10, and added the trove classifier.

- `#129 <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/pull/129>`__ improved the
  speed of the ``ImportableModuleFilter``.

- `#128 <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/pull/128>`__ fixed
  some issues with the packaging configuration.

7.2.0
=====

New Features
------------

- `#123 <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/pull/123>`__ adds
  the ``spelling_verbose`` configuration option for controlling
  whether misspelled words are printed to the console as well as the
  output log files. See :ref:`output-options` for details.

7.1.0
=====

New Features
------------

- `#116 <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/pull/116>`__ adds
  a config option `spelling_warning` that makes individual messages
  about misspellings warnings. The same change also updates the
  formatting of the message to make it easier for IDEs to parse,
  allowing the editor to navigate to the location of the misspelled
  word. See :ref:`output-options` for details.  Contributed by Robert
  Cohn.

7.0.1
=====

Bug Fixes
---------

- `#105 <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/pull/105>`__
  reverts a change that switched from `imp` to `importlib`. Using
  `importlib.find_spec()
  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.util.find_spec>`__
  is not safe at runtime as it can import modules which will cause
  side effects within environments.

7.0.0
=====

This major release drops support for Python 3.5. This version `is not
maintained anymore
<https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/#end-of-life-branches>`__.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixes an issue with ellipsis incorrectly being interpreted as
  relative imports and triggering a `ValueError` in the
  `ImportableModuleFilter`. See `#96
  <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling/issues/96>`__ for
  details.

6.0.0
=====

With this release, sphinxcontrib-spelling moves from beta to
stable. It also updates the use of Python 3, including packaging
metadata, code style, and test configuration.

New Features
------------

- Add packaging metadata declaring the project stable.
- Add packaging metadata declaring support for Python 3 only.
- Add packaging metadata indicating that this is a sphinx extension.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Replace use of deprecated `imp` module with `importlib`.
- Update use of `pyenchant.get_tokenizer()` to pass filters argument
  as a keyword and avoid a runtime warning message.
- Remove unused test dependency on `fixtures`.
- Use `pyupgrade` to modernize the source code.

5.4.0
=====

New Features
------------

- Added a new filter
  (``sphinxcontrib.spelling.filters.ContributorFilter``) that treats
  contributor names extracted from the git history as spelled
  correctly, making it easier to refer to the names in
  acknowledgments . Includes a new configuration option,
  ``spelling_ignore_contributor_names`` to enable it.

5.3.0
=====

New Features
------------

- Add a configuration option ``spelling_exclude_patterns`` to manage
  skipping spell checking for some input files. The option uses a
  list of glob-style patterns that are matched against the source
  file names relative to the source directory. See :doc:`/customize`
  for more details. Contributed by sdelliot.

5.2.2
=====

Bug Fixes
---------

- Updated to only create ``.spelling`` output files for inputs that
  generate spelling warnings. Fixes #63.

5.2.0
=====

New Features
------------

- The builder is now registered using an entry point, so that if the
  ``spelling`` directive is not used in a project
  ``sphinxcontrib.spelling`` does not need to be included explicitly
  in the ``extensions`` list in ``conf.py`` in order to use it with
  the project on the command line.

- PyEnchant is an optional dependency. If it is not installed, the
  spell checker will not work, but the extension can still be
  initialized. This allows projects that use spell checking to
  publish their documentation to ``readthedocs.org``, where it is
  not possible to install PyEnchant.

- Restore support for parallel builds. Words that do not appear in
  any configured dictionary are written to a file named based on the
  input file, with the ``.rst`` extension replaced with
  ``.spelling``.
