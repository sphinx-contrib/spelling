README for sphinx-contrib
=========================

This repository contains a collection of Sphinx_ extensions maintained by
their respective authors.  It is not an official part of Sphinx.

.. _Sphinx: http://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx


Installing
==========

Use ``setup.py`` in the subdirectory for the individual extension::

   cd dir
   python setup.py build
   sudo python setup.py install


Contributing
============

If you want to add your own extension, please write an e-mail to
georg@python.org and give your bitbucket user name; you will then
get write access to the public repo at
http://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx-contrib.

Send wishes, comments, patches, etc. for individual extensions
to their author as given in the module.


List of extensions
==================


For contributors
================

When adding or updating your extension, please adhere to these guidelines:

* Use ``make-ext.py`` to set up your extension subdirectory.
* Each extension must be either a submodule or subpackage of the
  ``sphinxcontrib`` package.  The ``sphinxcontrib/__init__.py`` file in your
  package must not be changed.
* Each extension must be listed in this file under "List of extensions" above.
* Each author should be listed in ``AUTHORS`` along with the extension name.
* It would be good to have all extensions BSD licensed; otherwise make a note in
  an ``ext/LICENSE`` file.
* Each extension can maintain a changelog and readme file; these files should
  be called ``ext/CHANGES`` and ``ext/README``, respectively.
